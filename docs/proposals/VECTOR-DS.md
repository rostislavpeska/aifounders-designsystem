# VECTOR-DS — a vectorized design system, GitHub-canonical

**Status: BUILT + LIVE-TESTED 2026-07-07 (roadmap item 4).** The store,
ingest and search exist and answered a real query on day one — built AFTER
the operator-mandated pattern check of the existing n8n vectorization
workflows (positions/courses/FAQ ingests + positions RAG search) and
conformant to the house pattern throughout:

- **Supabase** `public.ds_component_vectors` (standard documents shape,
  RLS on) + `match_ds_components(query_embedding, match_count, filter)` —
  mirrors `match_positions`, house `_`-operator grammar, DS-specific
  `_class_like` (classes) + `_token_like` (token_refs), `_min_similarity`.
- **n8n ingest** `AIF Sub: DS Vector Ingest (components)` — **PULL model**
  (operator correction 2026-07-07: "we already have GitHub connection" —
  the push variant + repo-side env vars died same day): the key-gated
  webhook `POST /webhook/ds-vector-ingest` (body optional
  `{owner?, repo_name?}`) makes n8n fetch `assets/ds-rows.json` ITSELF
  via the existing **"GitHub account"** credential (same github-node
  file:get pattern as Main Harvester 2). Source repo = the `Repo Params`
  default — factory now, `aifounders-designsystem` after the flip (one
  default). Then guard-abort-if-0 → scoped wipe (`website=designsystem`)
  → LangChain Supabase Vector Store insert, `text-embedding-3-small`
  1536d, loader auto-chunks ~1000 chars (a component = 1–3 chunks).
  ⚠️ Gate discovered live: the n8n GitHub token is select-repos scoped —
  it must be granted access to `aig-desigsystem` (and later
  `aifounders-designsystem`); GitHub 404s private repos it can't see, and
  the guard correctly refused to wipe.
- **n8n search** `AIF DS Components RAG Search (MCP)` — `POST
  /webhook/rag-search-ds-components`, same shape as the positions RAG
  search: embed → RPC → dedupe-to-components → router payload (name,
  classes, token_refs, repo, git_path, git_ref, doc_path, specimen,
  figma_node_id, code_connect, similarity). `match_count` is chunk-level;
  over-fetch ~3×.
- **Repo side:** the `ds-lookup` skill only (`.claude/skills/ds-lookup/`
  — the §12 primary surface): agents query via the n8n MCP with ZERO
  config (the API key is self-served by reading the workflow's key-check
  node), and the skill encodes the router contract: search → read
  doc_path/git_path → verify specimen → compose, never invent. No env
  vars, no push script (`build/vectorize.mjs` existed for one commit).
- **Smoke test (live):** "email signup form on the dark footer with a
  conjoined submit button" → Newsletter capture, similarity 0.518, full
  router metadata. Remaining: operator grants the n8n GitHub token access
  to the DS repo(s), then one webhook call rebuilds the full 40-row
  store; optional `availableInMCP` flip of the search workflow into the
  public aif MCP surface (§12 secondary).

Living document; the ledger (§6) and open questions (§11) still churn.

Per the harvest-before-values law: every claim about existing infra below is
read from the live AIF Supabase project or the harvested theme repos, never from
memory.

---

## 1. Purpose

Make the design system **retrievable by intent** so an agent (in any repo, or on
the Figma side) can ask *"which component do I reach for, and what's its
contract?"* and get a pointer to the canonical source — without loading the whole
system into context.

Not the goal: storing exact values in vectors. Not the goal: a second source of
truth. See §3.

## 2. Topology — three surfaces, one direction of truth

```
GitHub (aig-desigsystem)  ──canonical──►  everything
   │  tokens.json, components.css, .ds.yaml
   │
   ├─ build ─► CSS (shipped)
   ├─ sync  ─► Figma variables + Code Connect      (design surface)
   ├─ ingest─► Supabase pgvector rows               (retrieval index)
   └─ gate  ─► Playwright contract layers L0–L4     (verification, §10)
```

- **GitHub is canonical for both tokens and components.** Git is the version
  authority.
- **Figma is the design surface.** Variables are pushed *from* the token JSON,
  never authored as canon.
- **Supabase is a derived, rebuildable index.** It must be 100% regenerable from
  GitHub by CI on every push. One-way sync only. Nothing is ever *authored* in
  Supabase.

## 3. The three laws that keep it from rotting

1. **Supabase is a cache, never a source.** The moment a fact lives in Supabase
   and not in git, there are two truths and the index starts lying. If it can't
   be rebuilt from a clean checkout, it's wrong.

2. **The vector is a router, not a value store.** Embeddings are lossy; token
   values and prop signatures must be exact. So: the vector *finds* the
   component and returns a pointer; the agent then reads the canonical structured
   record verbatim for values. `vector = router · GitHub = truth`.

3. **A component earns a row only if the DS owns or themes it, on a themed
   surface.** Three outcomes at the gate:
   - **Canonical** DS component → row now.
   - **Themed third-party** (e.g. wrapped editor) → one *theming-contract* row
     describing how the DS dresses it, not an atom row.
   - **Drift** (invented in a theme/plugin, not in canon) → **promote into the
     canonical DS with tokens first, then row.** Never index the fork.

**Corollary — vectorization is a drift audit.** You cannot give a row a
`git_path` into `aig-desigsystem` if the component only exists in a theme.
Trying to write the row is what exposes the drift. This is a feature.

## 4. Row-granularity rule

> **Granularity follows intent divergence, not stylesheet classes and not DOM
> tags.** Two things that share CSS but are reached for in different situations →
> two rows. Two things with different CSS you'd never search for separately →
> one row. The embedded prose answers "when do I reach for this," so rows
> partition the *decision space*, not the stylesheet.

Worked example: checkbox, radio, and consent share one CSS system
(`.selection-*`) yet get **three** rows — their *when-to-use* genuinely diverges
(multi-select · single-select · legal consent). The stylesheet unifies them; the
decision space separates them; the rows follow the decision space.

## 5. Tokens vs components

| Layer | Canonical home | Vectorized? | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tokens** | GitHub `tokens.json` | **No** | Flat name→value. Any agent ingests them whole and reliably. Embedding adds lossiness for zero retrieval benefit — you never want an agent *guessing* a hex from a vector. Ship the file. |
| **Components** | GitHub `components.css` + `.ds.yaml` | **Yes** | The value is retrieval-by-intent — "which component, when, why, what breaks." That's the behavioral knowledge agents fail to absorb, and the one thing embeddings genuinely help with. |

Grounding: AIF's own published articles (in the internal vector store) already
field-tested this — *agents adopt tokens fast; components and behavioral
contracts are the hard part.* This proposal is built on that finding, not
against it.

## 6. Component ledger (forms domain — the pilot)

Derived from the real seams in `assets/css/components.css` (`.form-*`,
`.selection-*`, `.input-pair`) plus the write-article template.

**Atoms**
1. **Input** — text field (`.form-group` + `.form-control` + label/helper/error/
   mandatory). **Textarea is a variant here, not a sibling** — it shares the
   entire wrapper/label/helper/error/disabled system.
2. **Select** — pick-from-known-set (`.form-select-*` popover).
3. **Datepicker** — pick-a-date. Shares the popover mechanic with Select
   (`metadata.shares_pattern: popover-panel`); rows stay separate (intent
   differs).
4. **Checkbox** — multi-select / boolean opt-in.
5. **Radio** — single-select, mutually exclusive.
6. **Consent (GDPR)** — `.selection-item--consent`; distinct legal intent
   (mandatory, quiet voice) justifies its own row despite shared CSS.
7. **SegmentedControl** ✓ — pill toggle. **PROMOTED 2026-07-04** (branch
   `forms-split`) into canonical `assets/css/components.css` as `.segmented` /
   `.segmented-option` / `.segmented-option--active`; theme-local
   `.aif-form__toggle` is now the drift to be retired at adoption. Single-select,
   drives disclosure. *None/Podcast/Video is one instance; the atom is generic.*
8. **FileDropzone** ✓ — drag&drop / click-to-browse / preview / remove.
   **PROMOTED 2026-07-04** (branch `forms-split`) as `.dropzone` /
   `.is-dragover` (shipped name — matches the theme JS hook; §6 earlier said `.dropzone--dragover`, corrected audit 2026-07-06) / `.dropzone-preview` / `.dropzone-remove`; theme-local
   `.aif-publish__image-dropzone` is the drift to retire. Proven reusable —
   served both image and audio on the same template.

**Patterns**
- **Forms-composition** — the highest-value row. Holds the cross-cutting laws:
  field-scale (`.form-scale-small`/large), `input-pair` layout primitive,
  label/helper/error/mandatory conventions, validation timing, `focus-within`
  behavior, and the **disclosure/reveal** pattern (a pill reveals its panel).

**Theming contracts**
- **Markdown editor (Toast UI)** — third-party lib mounted in
  `aif-publisher/admin-editor.php` (replaces Gutenberg). DS owns only the toolbar
  theming, not the component. One theming-contract row, sits beside the
  ecomail-form harvest context, not beside Input.

**Excluded**
- `aif-publisher/review.php` — wp-admin diff screen, hardcoded hex, un-tokenized.
  Admin chrome. Never enters the store.

✓ **PROMOTION DONE (2026-07-04, branch `forms-split`).** `SegmentedControl` and
`FileDropzone` were canonicalised into `assets/css/components.css` using only
existing field tokens (zero new tokens → no token-file churn), documented as
their own Forms styleguide blocks (7 · and 8 ·), and shipped green through the
gate (css lint LAWS 1–4 ✓, `playwright tokens.spec.js` 48/48 ✓). The theme-local
`.aif-form__*` / `.aif-publish__*` markup is now the drift to retire at adoption.
Both are therefore row-eligible: `git_path: assets/css/components.css#segmented`
and `#dropzone`.

## 7. Supabase-ready row shape

Mirror the existing AIF `documents` shape exactly so the proven ingest + MCP
search cover it for free (see §9). One row per component (or per section for big
ones). `content` is embedded; `metadata` is fetched verbatim.

```jsonc
{
  "id": "uuid",
  // EMBEDDED — similarity ranks on this. Write it for recall: intent, not API.
  "content": "Button — the primary action trigger. Use for the single most \
important action in a view. Variants: primary (one per view), secondary, ghost, \
destructive (irreversible only, always paired with confirm). NOT for navigation \
(use Link). NOT for toggles (use Switch). Contract: disabled means 'not yet', \
never 'not allowed'. Loading replaces label, keeps width. A11y: visible focus …",

  // NOT embedded — the truth payload, fetched verbatim
  "metadata": {
    "name": "Button",
    "git_path": "assets/css/components.css#button",   // canonical pointer
    "git_ref": "060d1bc",                              // commit sha → staleness
    "variants": ["primary","secondary","ghost","destructive"],
    "states": ["default","hover","focus","disabled","loading"],
    "token_refs": ["--color-brand","--radius-md","--space-3"], // NAMES, not values
    "shares_pattern": null,
    "figma_node_id": "1:2345",
    "code_connect": "src/components/Button.tsx",
    "depends_on": ["Icon","Spinner"],
    "type": "component",
    "visibility": "public"
  },
  "embedding": "vector(1536)"   // text-embedding-3-small, matches the corpus
}
```

Discipline:
- `token_refs` are **names only** — values live in `tokens.json` and reach the
  agent whole.
- `git_ref` lets CI detect stale rows (row sha ≠ HEAD → re-ingest).
- One intent search returns code path **and** Figma node **and** Code Connect map
  in a single hit — that's the "ultra-fast dev" payoff and how the Figma leg is
  wired in.

## 8. Sync mechanism (proposed, not built)

- Source of change: `.ds.yaml` per component + `tokens.json`, committed to GitHub.
- On push → CI → n8n `vector-ingest` webhook (the existing AIF pattern, §9),
  **changed components only** (diff against `git_ref` stored on each row).
- `url`/stable key is the dedup key → re-ingest replaces, never duplicates.
- Note: a raw SQL edit does **not** re-embed — only re-ingesting recomputes the
  embedding. SQL-only edits are invisible to search.

## 9. Reference infra (already exists — reuse, don't invent)

AIF Supabase project `vxhhfbrxpvapxvjwgnzr` (eu-west-1, Postgres 17, `pgvector`
0.8.0, ivfflat+hnsw). Every vector store on it is the **same shape on purpose**:

| table | rows | role |
|---|---|---|
| `documents` | 89,420 | external scraped corpus |
| `aif_internal_article_vectors` | 4,301 | AIF's own articles |
| `faq_vectors` | 95 | FAQ |
| `aig_position_vectors` | 1,276 | job positions |

Table comment, verbatim: *"Standard documents shape (id, content, metadata,
embedding) … so the same n8n ingest pattern + LangChain Vector Store nodes can be
reused."* Embed model `text-embedding-3-small` (1536-dim). Ingest via the
`vector-ingest` n8n webhook. One `match_*` RPC per table. A DS store would be a
5th table in this exact mold + a `match_design_components` RPC.

## 10. Verification layer — the gate is part of the architecture

The agentic DS has a fourth surface the topology in §2 implies but never
named: **the gate**. Agents are both the main committers and the main
consumers of test feedback, so the gate is the reviewer — and our own field
finding applies (*Agent Deployment Is a Design System Decision*): incidents
that were review-detectable at human speed accumulate faster than review at
agent speed. Full design, evidence and rollout live in
**[PLAYWRIGHT-AGENTIC.md](PLAYWRIGHT-AGENTIC.md)** (researched 2026-07-06:
23 verified claims, 2 refuted); this section is the architectural summary.

**Layers** (all local, against the live :8090 stack; CI runs only L0 — it has
no WP server):

| layer | file | guards |
|---|---|---|
| L0 | `build/lint-css.mjs` + tokens-in-sync | the 3-layer/breakpoint laws, headless (CI ✓) |
| L1 | `tests/tokens.spec.js` *(exists)* | token contracts — value × surface × scale |
| L2 | `tests/layout.spec.js` *(planned)* | broken screens: overflow, occlusion (`elementFromPoint` — Playwright can't see overlap natively, won't-fix), zero-size, console errors, failed requests |
| L3 | `tests/a11y.spec.js` *(planned)* | axe, graduated Carbon-style: baseline → no-new-violations → per-tab zero ratchet |
| L4 | `tests/interactions.spec.js` *(planned)* | behavior contracts — the "right-looking wrong thing" |

**Laws** (mirror the laws in §3):

1. **Assertion-first; screenshots are for humans.** Named structured failures
   are what agents act on (Playwright MCP feeds agents accessibility trees,
   not pixels — by design). `toHaveScreenshot` as a gate was rejected on
   evidence: baselines are OS-bound, Docker determinism was refuted 0-3, and
   under agent commit velocity baseline churn turns the gate into ceremony.
   Screenshots stay an operator-judgment artifact (they caught the
   hallucinated segmented control; that is their job).
2. **Auto-discovery, never per-tab registration.** Sweeps crawl the styleguide
   sidebar at runtime — a tab added by any agent is covered the moment it
   exists. A gate that must be told about new work will miss exactly the
   newest (buggiest) work.
3. **One behavioral truth, two consumers.** The behavioral-contract prose in a
   component's vector row `content` (§7) and the assertions in its L4
   interaction test must be the same sentences. The row tells the agent what
   the component promises; the gate proves the promise still holds. If they
   diverge, one of them is lying — same corollary as §3's drift audit.

## 11. Open questions / next steps

- [x] **Promote `SegmentedControl` + `FileDropzone`** from the theme into
      canonical `components.css` (build + gate). *Done 2026-07-04, branch
      `forms-split` — see §6.*
- [x] **Split the Forms tab into per-element atom blocks** (Input → Dropzone,
      one documented block each) + a Composition section for the cross-cutting
      laws. *Done same branch; gate 48/48.*
- [ ] Retire the theme-local `.aif-form__*` / `.aif-publish__*` markup at
      adoption (point `page-author-publish.php` at the canonical classes).
- [x] ~~Decide `.ds.yaml` schema~~ **RESOLVED (audit Phase C, 2026-07-06):
      NO `.ds.yaml`** — rows are GENERATED by `build/rows.mjs` from the
      ledger + the per-component docs (`## Intent` → content; `## Tokens
      referenced` → token_refs; header `git_path`; HEAD → git_ref). One
      source, no drift; validated 40/40 rows, zero gaps. Output:
      `assets/ds-rows.json` (rebuildable, shippable). If a row is wrong,
      fix the DOC.
- [ ] Confirm: is the win big enough yet? For one repo / one maintainer, a good
      `DESIGN.md` + `tokens.json` may give ~90% of the value at ~5% of the infra.
      Vectors earn their keep when **many** agents/repos query by intent, or the
      DS is too big to hold in context. Name the concrete consumer before
      building the table.
- [ ] Draft the migration for the 5th table + `match_design_components` RPC.
- [ ] Draft the CI → n8n changed-components-only sync.
- [ ] Textarea: keep folded into Input, or split? (currently: folded — the weak
      split.)
- [x] ~~Build the gate layers L2–L4~~ **BUILT (audit 2026-07-06)**: L2
      layout sweep (caught 4 real broken-screen bugs on day one), L3 axe
      baseline (no-new-violations gate), L4 contracts pilot (modal +
      accordion — found + fixed the missing focus restore). Ratchet
      burn-down ongoing.
- [ ] When authoring `.ds.yaml` rows, source each component's behavioral prose
      and its L4 interaction assertions from the same contract text (§10 law 3).

## 12. Serving architecture — HYBRID, skill-first (researched 2026-07-06)

Question ruled on: dedicated MCP server vs "webhook skill" for consuming the
store. Answer: **neither alone — one data plane, two thin adapters**, matching
the 2026 consensus (MCP = the transport/nervous system, skills = the playbook;
you want both, each where it's cheap).

**Data plane (build once):** the 5th Supabase table + `match_design_components`
RPC (§7–9), ingested by the existing n8n `vector-ingest` webhook from CI
(changed rows only, keyed on `git_ref`). Read-only from everywhere; Supabase
stays a rebuildable cache (§3 law 1).

**Adapter 1 — the `ds-lookup` SKILL (primary; ships IN the public repo):**
a consumer-facing skill whose body carries the query contract: when to reach
for the store, how to call the search endpoint (n8n search webhook wrapping
embed+match), and the router discipline — the row returns a POINTER
(`git_path` + token NAMES); the agent then reads canon verbatim and ingests
`tokens.css`/manifest whole. Progressive disclosure = ~1 description line of
standing context. This natively reaches the ACTUAL next consumers: the two
theme-refactor agents (roadmap item 5) working inside repos, any repo that
copies the skill, and Managed Agents via the Skills API. This is the
"plugin architecture" instinct, made concrete.

**Adapter 2 — a tool on the EXISTING production MCP (secondary):** the AIF MCP
server already exposes vector-search tools over sibling tables (e.g. internal
articles); adding `ds_search_components` beside them is near-zero marginal
infra and buys the surfaces skills can't reach (claude.ai web/mobile/Desktop
connectors; `mcp_servers` on Managed Agents). NOT a new dedicated DS MCP
server — one more tool on the server that exists. Operator owns MCP config;
server-side addition needs no client JSON.

**Explicitly rejected:** a standalone DS MCP server (registration + auth +
maintenance for ~1 tool over a ~40–60-row corpus); embedding token VALUES
(§3 law 2); any write path outside CI ingest.

**Scale honesty (per §11's own question):** at ~40–60 rows the whole
decision-space index fits in one file — the embeddings' payoff here is
intent-matching (fuzzy/bilingual queries) and cross-repo reach, not scale.
The skill should therefore also name the degraded path: if the endpoint is
unreachable, read `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` (the ledger IS the row list).
